# video converter

Description
---

A video converter made using python based on ffmpeg to convert video files (supported by FFmpeg) to mp4 format.

Requirements
---

You will need to have [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed properly to use this program.
You can "install" FFmpeg on Windows by following these steps:

  1. Download FFmpeg from [this repository](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases)
  2. Extract the archive to somewhere permanent on your pc.
  3. Add a PATH entry for the `bin` folder of the extracted files. (you can do this by changing the `PATH` environment variable)

Future plans
---

My future plans are to add support for a wider range of video formats and to make the UI more user-friendly. I am considering intergrating FFmpeg rather than it being a pre-requisite.
